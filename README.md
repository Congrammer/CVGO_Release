## Note: 📝📝📝
* If you want to use GHUB mouse simulation method, you MUST use old version of GHUB driver (older than 2022.03), or use LGS instead, or use provided [patch](https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/ltovos/how_to_install_old_ghub_works_no_auto_update/) to reverse back GHUB version
* **Password is located at the INSTRUCTION channel of my discord server**
* Don't include "ID: " or "KEY: " when entering...... But need to include that "key/" which is not capitalized
* Arduino code not work for all mouses (this one supports most mouses include Logitech and Razer), need to be modified if not working well
* You MUST test turn around data using [turn_around.exe](Test_turn_around/turn_around_ex.exe) first and every time after you changed mouse sensitivity settings

## External hardwares 🖱️🖱️🖱️
<details>
<summary>KMBOX</summary>

* External hardware (KMBOX) can be purchased at [Taobao](https://world.taobao.com/item/659201542143.htm), also its [Superbuy link](https://www.superbuy.com/en/page/buy/?nTag=Home-search&from=search-input&_search=url&position=&url=https%3A%2F%2Fworld.taobao.com%2Fitem%2F659201542143.htm). If its default mode is not compatible with your mouse, use [kma_parser](Kmbox_A/kma_parser.exe) to switch modes
* Please use version A of kmbox ![image](Kmbox_A/kmbox_a.png)

<summary>Arduino Leonardo + USB host shield</summary>

* External hardware (Arduino Leonardo + USB host shield) can be purchased at [Amazon - Arduino Leonardo](https://www.amazon.com/KEYESTUDIO-Leonardo-Development-Board-Arduino/dp/B0786LJQ8K/) and [Amazon - USB host shield](https://www.amazon.com/ARCELI-Shield-Arduino-Support-Android/dp/B07J2KKGZ4/) or [Ebay - USB host shield](https://www.ebay.com/itm/393311967986), and here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dxwU87GQVM) shows how you should install them
* If you choose to use Arduino, do realize that you need to solder those three lacations ![image](Arduino/Notice.png)

## Upcoming: 📆📆📆
* Using TRT to boost speed (done, planned to add only in pro version, done, evaluating, seems not necessary)
* Using new "nice-looking" gui (Done)✅
* Safer version which pure relies on python.exe (Done)✅
* Support Arduino Leonardo + USB host shield (Done)✅
* Hide process from task manager (Done, test not safe)⚠
* Better weights for Valorant and PUBG (Delayed)
* Accurate recoil control for some games (Done for CSGO, available only in pro version)✅
* Players can download at different time will get different files (with same file names but content changed)
* Free version

## Promotion 🎈🎈🎈
* Join our [new Discord](https://discord.gg/qkvkT7y7mZ) for **password** and free trial (one day, ends on Oct 7th, 2022), where also provide a channel for development discussion
* AIMBOT IS NOT free, join the server for details (please read), but I will also release a free version
* There is a FREE weights shared previously for people who want to code their own program. Enjoy. (class 0: head; class 1: body, 416*416, Yolov4-tiny)
* Also a slightly modified version of [labelimg](Free_stuffs/labelImg_cx.exe), with zoom up to 1000% and no fuzzy, better for moving tiny labels
* Proof of [work on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyDKoZcyp2vDvskHFviRtag)
* BE A PRO IN CSGO/CROSSFIRE/VALORANT/APEX/NZ/PUBG & so on !!!
* QQ Group 778907895

## Features 👍👍👍
* Different checksum for different user
* One program works on many fps games
* Light weight YOLO AIMBOT with fantastic performance (low GPU usage)
* Well-trained models
* Does not read/write memory, no virus and fill free to scan (except for ESET which take all packers as potential virus)
* Smooth human-like mouse move at all FPS values, random speed of mouse clicks
* Custom shortcut keys, custom mouse move speed, custom aiming positions, various supported battle modes
* Enhanced object tracking using PID system (optimized for both static and moving targets)
* Support different types of mouse simulation to bypass *** platforms
* Welcome to try with your secondary accounts, see the facts with your own eyes without losing and regretting
